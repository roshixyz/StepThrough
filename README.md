This project allows users to visually step through Python code solutions for LeetCode problems. It provides an interactive interface that highlights the current line of execution, along with real-time insights into the values of variables and sub-expressions at each step of the program.

Key Features:
![](Screenshot.png)
- Step-through Execution: The program visually highlights the current line being executed, allowing users to follow the flow of the code.
- Variable Tracking: Users can view the values of key variables at each step, making it easier to understand how the program progresses and how data is manipulated.
- Sub-expressions Evaluation: Displays the intermediate results of sub-expressions and their evaluation, aiding in the understanding of complex logic.

### Usage
