Key Features:
- Step-through Execution: The program visually highlights the current line being executed, allowing users to follow the flow of the code.
- Variable Tracking: Users can view the values of key variables at each step, making it easier to understand how the program progresses and how data is manipulated.
- Sub-expressions Evaluation: Displays the intermediate results of sub-expressions and their evaluation, aiding in the understanding of complex logic.
